Intro to python projects via baseball

# download to computer
1. Run `git clone https://github.com/colinhmit/baseball.git` from your terminal.
  * If you don’t have git, try `git` or `brew install git` first. Otherwise, google installing git on your operating system.

# files
There are two files:

1.bball_framework_simple.py
   bball_framework_simple is the barebones minimum. Start here.  
   Run `python bball_framework_simple.py` to see the end results of a game.
2.bball_framework_example.py
   This has a better advance_runners function, and uses print statements to show the game.
   Run `python bball_framework_example.py` for a cool demo, but try not to look at the code until you’re done!

# running python files
1. Make sure you’re in the `baseball` directory in your terminal
2. Run `python file_name.py` to run the python script.
  * a `-i` modifier will keep the python session open after the script finishes.

# getting started
1. Spend some time trying to implement something yourself. This is important.
2. If you got it, great! Otherwise, check out bball_framework_simple for ideas.
3. Once you understand bball_framework_simple, try to rewrite the `advance_runners` function to be more elegant.
